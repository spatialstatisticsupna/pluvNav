# pluvNav

The goal of `pluvNav` is to provide tools for searching and downloading pluviometric data for the province of Navarre. It allows the user to:
1. Search basic information from pluviometric stations.
2. Download pluviometric data for any number of available stations in csv format.
3. Unify csv files for any dates and stations of the same type into a single csv file for easier managing. (Note that Automatic stations tend to have more available variables than manual stations)
